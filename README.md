# Travel-Expert-System-Knowledge-Base

Using expert system frameworks to create expert systems. These "shells" are empty Expert System knowledge bases; all we have to do is add the knowledge to them. The structure and interface of these shells have already been written for us. For this issue, we will build and construct an expert system utilising a tiny expert system shell rather than writing an expert system from scratch. For constructing the relevant expert system, we utilised the PyKnow Framework.

## Package Used

Pyknow

## Idea

People want to travel to different cities but have no clue regarding where to travel keeping up with their preferenecs.
